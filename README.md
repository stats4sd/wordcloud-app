# Readme - (specifications):

## Requirements: 
Demo application showing the following pages: 
1. Data Session (input)
2. Data Session (output)
3. Space for additional meeting feedback. 

### Data Session (input)
The input should be a simple free-text field.  
- No limit (within reason) on length. 
- Submit comment to an online database, for real-time processing by R server. 

Additionally, 
### Data Session (output)
This page will draw outputs from the R server, including: 
- image of a wordcloud
- frequency histogram.
- viewable on mobile, but intended to be a permanent display on a projector (desktop screen), so view should be "good" on a big screen. 

### Space for additional meeting feedback
Options for other feedback questions might be requested for other parts of the meeting. For now, this is just a placeholder space.
