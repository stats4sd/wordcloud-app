      <h1>What is this app?</h1>
      <p>This web app is intended to allow meeting participants to submit personal comments about the discussions occurring. The comments can be tagged with one or more relevant tags.  The comments are then added to a database and processed on our R server. The results are displayed on a Shiny-R dashboard, available<a href="http://shiny.stats4sd.org/word-demo">here</a></p>
      <p>Users can also add their own tags to the database through the app. New tags appear for anyone viewing the app almost instantly, as long as the users are online.  This means the tags available will be relevant to the ongoing discussions, rather than being preset.</p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>The app is intended for online use. In this demo, the comment submissions will quietly fail if you are offline.  In the final version, we will fix this so the submissions are disabled while offline so users don't lose comments.</p>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p> Use the sidebar menu to navigate to the Add Comment page.  (on mobile, the sidebar is accessed via the 3 line icon in the top-left). From there, you can add a comment, select one or more tags from the list, and submit it.  You can also add a tag at the bottom of the page.</p>
